# MicromagneticSimulationExamples
 Code examples of my simulation scripts in magpar and mumax3. I used these during my PhD.
 
 Both these packages use configuration files. On top of these, you can write scripts to do pre and post processing.
 
 I will show examples of scripting in linux for magpar, since it is better to run it in the virtualmicromagnetics environment, and in windows for mumax3
 
 Finally, I will show how to use paraview (both gui and scripting) for visualizing your results
 
 Hope you find something useful
