# MicromagneticSimulationExamples
 Code examples of my simulation scripts in magpar and mumax3. I used these during my PhD.
 
 Both these packages use configuration files. On top of these, you can write scripts to do pre and post processing.
 
 Each folder contains examples of scripting in linux for magpar, since it is better to run it in the virtualmicromagnetics environment, and in windows for mumax3.
 
 Also in those folders there is a Paraview "recipe" listing the filters used for visualizing the results and a python "trace" in case the rendering is to be done in a (non GUI) cluster.
  
 Hope you find something useful
